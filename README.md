## About Dataset
The dataset is designed for predicting whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on the number of study hours and their scores in the previous exam.

## Features:
Study Hours (numeric): Represents the number of hours a student spent studying for the upcoming exam.
Previous Exam Score (numeric): Indicates the student's score in the previous exam.
Pass/Fail (binary): The target variable, where 1 represents a pass and 0 represents a fail in the current exam.

## SOURCES
* Source of Data: The dataset for "Student Exam Performance Prediction" is entirely synthetic, generated for the purpose of creating a sample dataset for a binary classification problem. No real-world student information was used in its creation.

* Data Generation Process: The data was generated using Python programming language and the NumPy library to simulate a diverse set of student behaviors and exam performances. The key features include "Study Hours," "Previous Exam Score," and the binary target variable "Pass/Fail."
